        <p class="title">The real me</p>
        <p>My name is Leo. I am a Chinese born and grew up in Shanghai, a modern international metropolis and the economic and financial center of China. I graduated from East China Normal University (ECNU), one 985 and 211 comprehensive domestic famous universities. I majored in Computer Science and Technology in ECNU for 6 and a half years and have got bachelor's and master's degree.</p>
        <p>During gradute, I have completed two papers on SOA and Data Mining theories. With the papers, I also implemented one software for data mining language lexical analysis and parsing, and applying results to data mining based on data warehouse under SOA.</p>
        <p>But something changed. In the last two years before graduation, I began to find that there were art cells in my mind and I began to like the front-end development. During that period, I worked for three companies -- one state-owned enterprise, one joint venture and one foreign company -- as one internship mainly on front-end development.</p>
        <p>After gradute and so far, I have been working for DELL/SonicWall Inc., and I'm still one front-end develop engineer. But on the other hand, I am a fantast. I like to use writing to record my whimsy and my life. If you like me, my site and my life, not to hesitate to contact me. :-)</p>
